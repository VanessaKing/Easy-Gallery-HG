Easy Gallery HG
===============

Simple gallery script using an index.php file and a 'photos' folder of images.

Example:
http://halgatewood.com/free/gallery/gatewood/

Installation
------------
* Create a folder where you want the gallery to be: /gatewood/
* Add index.php to that folder
* Create a photos folder inside of that old folder: /gatewood/photos
* Add your images to the photos folder
* In your browser visit the new page and click 'Build Images'

Adding More Photos
------------
After each build of the images the script will lock that page. 
This will keep people from building your images all the time.

In your main directory edit the file photos.json and set the variable 'locked' to 'false'
